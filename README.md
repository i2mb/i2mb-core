# Maßkrug
Maßkrug is an agent based simulation system that uses agent behaviours and physical motion to determine contact patterns and viral load transmission. 

# Name history
The inspiration for the simulator came from an effort to understand how pandemics could affect daily life, in particular, their effect on tradiotional events such as the "Bergkirchweih" in Erlangen. The simulator's name, Maßkrug, is inspired from the traditional beer glassed used during many folk festivals in Bavaria and adjecent regions.
