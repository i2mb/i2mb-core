Individual to Mass Behaviour (I2MB) is an agent-based simulation system that uses agent behaviours and physical motion
to determine contact patterns and viral load transmission. 

To replicate the work from "Impact of Digital Contact Tracing on SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Control Analysed with Behaviour-driven Agent-based Modelling", please visit the [dct-covid-bd-abm](https://github.com/i2mb/dct-covid-bd-abm) repository for detailed use instructions.
