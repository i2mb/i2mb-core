"""> For individuals infected with B.1.1.7, the mean duration of the proliferation phase was 5.3 days (90% credible 
interval [2.7, 7.8]), the mean duration of the clearance phase was 8.0 days [6.1, 9.9], and the mean overall duration 
of infection (proliferation plus clearance) was 13.3 days [10.1, 16.5]. These compare to a mean proliferation phase 
of 2.0 days [0.7, 3.3], a mean clearance phase of 6.2 days [5.1, 7.1], and a mean duration of infection of 8.2 days [ 
6.5, 9.7] for non-B.1.1.7 virus. The peak viral concentration for B.1.1.7 was 19.0 Ct [15.8, 22.0] compared to 20.2 
Ct [19.0, 21.4] for non-B.1.1.7. This converts to 8.5 log10 RNA copies/ml [7.6, 9.4] for B.1.1.7 and 8.2 log10 RNA 
copies/ml [7.8, 8.5] for non-B.1.1.7. Data and code are available online.4 > > N = 65 > >
