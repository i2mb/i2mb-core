# Todo
-[X] Verify calculation of R
-[ ] Use R from literature
-[X] Asymptomatic ratio from literature

# Features
-[X] Percentage of the population with contact tracing list, i.e., as the population is generated, not all particles
 are given the contact tracing property, and thus only contact tracing is possible between particles with the property.
-[X] Life time of contacts on each particle's list
-[X] Time to isolation (Delay)
-[ ] Probability of successful contact exchange => to control false negative rate.
-[X] Time in contact before exchange relative to time in contact for infection.
-[ ] Additional contacts tracked without risk of infection (walls, doors, cars, etc.) => needs assumptions about 
probability of these situations (maybe from literature).
-[ ] Considering the FP rate, prob. of success of isolation.
-[ ] For completeness, probably without major effect: Assume some negative infection test probability for a test during
 isolation, admit individual back to population
-[ ] Isolation time, individuals are returned to the general population after x time has passed, regardless of the 

# The Main question
Can contact tracing work given the technology, reduce the area.

* Parameters should be backed up with data as much as possible.
    * Particles could be a weakness.
    * Different strategies: BT, GPS, QR code idea. Harmonize parameter set.


* Match with results presented on other papers.
* Follow up. Use real human routine databases. To make the nature model more precise.

# Observations
1. Contact tracing (CT) reduces the average duration of the pandemic, in proportion to the coverage of the CT app
2. Random motion can achieve an R_0 for the desired time by controlling the particle density in the space. The inclusion
 of points of interest only helps to increase th R_0 value.
